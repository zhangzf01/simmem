<scenario>
You are presented with the following task content:

---
You are randomly assigned to be the Persuader in this communication task.

As the persuader, your job is to persuade your partner to donate some or all of their incoming payment for this task ($2.00) to a children's charity called Save the Children.

You will earn a bonus equal to whatever amount your partner donates if they agree to donate. You can keep this bonus or donate it to maximize the charitable impact.

Required Actions:
- Ask for a SPECIFIC donation amount: "How much would you like to donate to the charity from your task payment?"
- Explain the deduction: "Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to your full payment ($2.00)."
- If your partner asks how the donation will get to the charity: "The research team will collect all donations and send them to Save the Children."

Conversation Strategy:
- Start with a greeting or small talk to open the conversation naturally.
- Build rapport gradually before discussing donations.
- {strategy}

Basic information about Save the Children:
Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.

You can refer to Save the Children's website to gather more information if you like to.

## Response Diversity Instructions

Instead of committing to a single response, generate {n} plausible replies
you (as the persuadee) might naturally give to your chat partner, along with
an estimated probability for each. The replies should be genuinely diverse —
differ in phrasing, tone, skepticism level, and (where appropriate) whether
or not to donate.

IMPORTANT: if a candidate reply represents a decision to donate or give
money, that candidate MUST include the literal structured marker
[DONATE $N] or [GIVE $N] where N is the amount. Otherwise the donation
will not be registered. Candidates that do not involve donating should
omit the marker entirely.

Return ONLY a JSON object with the key "responses" (a list of dictionaries,
each with 'text' and 'probability'):
- 'text': the reply string only, under {word_limit} words, no explanation
- 'probability': a number in [0.0, 1.0] representing how likely you are to
  give this particular reply (the probabilities should roughly sum to 1.0)

Example format:
{{"responses": [{{"text": "I'm not sure, I earned this money and want to spend it on myself.", "probability": 0.5}}, {{"text": "That's a worthy cause. [GIVE $0.25]", "probability": 0.2}}, {{"text": "Can you tell me more about the charity first?", "probability": 0.3}}]}}

Output ONLY the JSON object, no markdown fences, no explanations, no extra
text before or after.
